There are 3 codes:
Main
Customer
Waiter

Overview:

Main: This class basically just connects the threads together and is where the testing is.

Customer: Follows the customer requirements within the original project pdf provided by the professor.

Waiter: Follows the waiter requirements within the original project pdf provided by the professor.



Use basically any IDE to run the project.

    •   Compile the Code:
          o Open a terminal or command prompt.
          o Navigate to the directory where your Java files are located.
          o Compile the Java files using the javac command. For example:
          o javac project/Main.java

    •   Run the Project:
           o After successful compilation, run the main class. In your case, it seems to be the Main
               class.
           o java project.Main

    •   Observe the Output:
           o The program will start executing, and you should see output messages in the console
               indicating the actions of waiters and customers in your simulated restaurant.
    •   Wait for Completion:
           o The program is designed to simulate the interactions between customers and waiters. It
               will run until all customer threads have finished. The output will show the flow of events
               in the restaurant.
    •   Review Output:
           o Examine the console output to understand how customers enter the restaurant, get seated,
               place orders, eat, pay, and leave. The output should provide insights into the simulated
               restaurant's behavior.
    •   Termination:
           o Once the simulation completes, you will likely see a message indicating that all
               customers have left the restaurant, and the waiters have performed their leaving routines.
    •   Adjust Parameters (Optional)
